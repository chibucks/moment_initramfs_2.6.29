keymaps 0,8,1,4
# Don't change this line unless you want to rewrite this entire thing :)
# Here's how it works, the keymaps above mean how each key is modified
# by column. Example:
#			one exclam exclam nul
# means key 45 (one) will output one when pressed alone, exclamation when
# pressed with Alt (Fn), exclamation when pressed with Shift (Arrow),
# and nothing when pressed with Control (DPAD center). Trailing nuls can
# be omitted (note that's only one L in nul). Basically that's columns: 
# alone, with Fn, with Shift, and with Control (DPAD center).
